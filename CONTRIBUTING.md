## Hacktoberfest 2022

Hacktoberfest is digitalocean‚Äôs annual event that encourages people to
contribute to open source throughout october. Much of modern tech
infrastructure‚Äîincluding some of digitalocean‚Äôs own products‚Äîrelies on
open-source projects built and maintained by passionate people who often don‚Äôt
have the staff or budgets to do much more than keep the project alive.
Hacktoberfest is all about giving back to those projects, sharpening skills, and
celebrating all things open source, especially the people that make open source
so special.

For the past 9 years, thousands of people‚Äîcoders and non-coders alike‚Äîhave
participated in hacktoberfest to support the projects they use and love, learn
and practice skills that will enhance their careers, and meet new people who
love open source as much as they do.
