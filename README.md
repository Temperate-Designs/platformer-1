## Introduction

GEARS is a platformer Flutter project for Android which is basically a platform
game where you maneuver through a machine in different levels by hopping on
moving gears and other mechanical objects. The point of the game is to get to
the top of the machine where you complete the game by escaping the machine.
there are many levels that progressively get harder. Please have fun!

You can play the web version of this game at [https://temperate-designs.github.io/platformer-1/](https://temperate-designs.github.io/platformer-1/).
